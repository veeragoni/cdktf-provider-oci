# NPM Package Fix Documentation

## The Original Problem

When users installed `cdktf-provider-oci` from npm, they encountered errors because:
1. The package only contained a simple "Hello" class, not the actual OCI provider bindings
2. Attempting to import OCI resources resulted in "module not found" errors
3. The OCI provider bindings existed in the `generated/` directory but weren't being compiled into the npm package

## Root Cause

The OCI Terraform provider contains **thousands of resources and data sources**, resulting in:
- Massive generated TypeScript files (hundreds of MBs)
- JSII compilation running out of memory when trying to process all files
- npm package size limitations being exceeded

## The Solution

### Approach: Local Generation Pattern

Instead of trying to package all OCI provider bindings, the npm package now:
1. Provides clear setup instructions via a helper class
2. Includes TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Guides users to generate bindings locally using `cdktf get`

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. Updated `src/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Instead of trying to export thousands of OCI resources
// We provide a helper class and interface
export interface OciProviderConfig {
  readonly region: string;
  readonly tenancyOcid: string;
  readonly userOcid: string;
  readonly fingerprint: string;
  readonly privateKey: string;
}

export class OciProviderHelper {
  static setupInstructions(): string {
    // Returns instructions for local generation
  }
}
```

#### 2. Updated Documentation:
- Clear instructions that bindings must be generated locally
- Complete TypeScript and Python examples using local imports
- Explanation of why local generation is necessary

### For Users

Users now follow this workflow:

1. **Install the package** (for helper utilities and documentation):
```bash
npm install cdktf-provider-oci
```

2. **Configure their `cdktf.json`**:
```json
{
  "terraformProviders": ["oracle/oci@~> 7.19"]
}
```

3. **Generate bindings locally**:
```bash
cdktf get
```

4. **Import from local bindings**:
```typescript
import { OciProvider } from './.gen/providers/oci/provider';
import { CoreInstance } from './.gen/providers/oci/core-instance';
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No memory issues** - JSII doesn't need to compile thousands of files
✅ **Smaller package size** - npm package is lightweight
✅ **Always up-to-date** - Users can specify their preferred OCI provider version
✅ **Faster installation** - No need to download hundreds of MBs
✅ **Standard CDKTF pattern** - This is how most providers are used with CDKTF

## Version Bump

The package version has been updated to `0.0.1` to reflect these changes.

## Future Considerations

If a pre-built package is desired in the future, consider:
1. Using [@cdktf/provider-generator](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/tree/main/packages/%40cdktf/provider-generator)
2. Splitting into multiple packages by service (e.g., cdktf-oci-core, cdktf-oci-identity)
3. Creating a custom build process that bypasses JSII for the generated code
